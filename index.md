## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Iain Mathieson](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mathieson-lab/) at the Department of Genetics, where I also work with [Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ccb/) at the recently established Center for Computational Biomedicine. I earned my PhD in [Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I obtained my undergraduate degree in [Mathematical and Computational Science](https://mcs.stanford.edu/) (with Honors in Mathematical Biology) at Stanford. I am a [science communication](./scicomm.md) advocate, and I enjoy [baking and cooking](./food.md) whenever time permits.      

## Research Interests

- **Human Statistical Genomics:** population stratification detection, polygenic score transferability, genetic fine-mapping, variant effect predictor operationalization     
- **Mathematical and Computational Biology:** differential expression analysis, models of evolution, demographic inference, mathematical questions motivated by biological modeling

## News

- **[May 2025]** I received a [T32 Training Grant](https://genomedt32.med.upenn.edu/genemed/) in Genomic Medicine. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue working to improve generalizability of genetic findings, with support from Iain and [Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bogdan-group/). 
- **[Nov. 2024]** Our work on causal effect heterogeneity between admixed individuals was selected as a Reviewer's Choice Poster for ASHG 2024! While we are busy performing analyses on the All Of Us Biobank, feel free to check out the poster [here](https://alanaw1.github.io/assets/files/AAw_ASHG2024_poster.pdf). 
- **[Aug. 2023]** New website is up!
