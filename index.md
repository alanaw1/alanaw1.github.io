## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Iain Mathieson](https://www.med.upenn.edu/mathieson-lab/) at the Department of Genetics. I recently completed my PhD in [Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, where I worked with Yun Song and Nilah Ioannidis. I obtained my undergraduate degree in [Mathematical and Computational Science](https://mcs.stanford.edu/) (with Honors in Mathematical Biology) at Stanford. I enjoy [baking and cooking](./food.md) whenever time permits.      

## Research Interests

- **Human Statistical Genomics:** population stratification detection, polygenic score transferability, genetic fine-mapping, variant effect predictor operationalization     
- **Computational Biology:** differential expression analysis, models of evolution and demographic inference
