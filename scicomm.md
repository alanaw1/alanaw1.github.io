## STEM Communication

I used to devote time to professional, non-academic science communication. I interned at [Asian Scientist](https://asianscientist.com/) (now part of [Wildtype Media Group](https://www.wildtype.media/)), and was mentored by Dr. [Juliana Chan](https://wikitia.com/wiki/Juliana_M._Chan) and Dr. [Rebecca Tan](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-tan-science). 

My experience helped me think critically about how science impacts society beyond the ivory tower of academia: to recognize the [positive](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-017-9097-0) [outcomes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01292986.2016.1240819) that increased science communication brings about for society, and to encourage science communication in Asia, where it is historically [lacking](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/03/why-asia-needs-good-science-writers/). 

Presently, the science communication landscape has evolved tremendously, with podcasts and TikTok rising in popularity. There are also new challeges, including ensuring communication of trustworthy information in the age of AI-powered chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) and combatting misinformation and distrust in science. I hope to engage these issues more seriously in the future.
